# Charity Lottery

***For a better world, let us do more with fun.***

## How the system working

### Lottery subsystem

This is a soccer games results betting game, and it is based on the ethereum blockchain. Before one soccer game (for example, a England Premier Leagure game),  anyone can deposit some ether to bet the result. The stake token will be sended to the betting address. The stake token will be used when the people attend to the voting of the charity subsystem. When the game ended, the 90% of the total ether deposited will pay back to bet winner in proportion. The 10% remained will be funded to the charity subsystem.
